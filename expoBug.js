While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the linking of native modules. The error message wasn't very specific, only indicating a failure in the linking process.  The project built fine on my local machine, but the CI/CD pipeline failed with the linking error.  I had already followed all official Expo documentation and other resources I could find on the topic of native modules and linking. The error wasn't consistently reproducible across different CI/CD builds, sometimes succeeding and other times failing.
