After extensive debugging, it turned out that the inconsistency stemmed from variations in the Node.js version used between the local development environment and the CI/CD pipeline.  Furthermore, there were subtle differences in the cache directories and temporary file locations. 

The solution involved several steps:

1. **Explicitly setting Node.js version:**  Ensuring the same Node.js version (and npm version) is used across both local and CI/CD environments by using a version manager such as nvm or asdf. 
2. **Cleaning the Expo cache:** Introduced a step in the CI/CD pipeline to explicitly clean the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean`. 
3. **Explicitly setting environment variables:** ensured all environment variables crucial for the native module build were explicitly set. 
4. **Reproducible Build Steps:** Implemented stricter control over build processes in the CI/CD pipeline to avoid any ambiguity, including deleting intermediate or temporary files. 

By carefully matching the Node version, cleaning the cache, and strictly controlling the environment variables in CI, the inconsistency in linking native modules was resolved.
